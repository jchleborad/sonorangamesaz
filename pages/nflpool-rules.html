  <h2 class="mb-4">🏈 Official Rules — NFL 2025 Season Pool</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the NFL 2025 Pool! The goal is simple: pick the most winners each week — and throughout the season — to earn your way into the prize pool. Here’s how it works:</p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">📌 How to Play</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each week, you'll receive a form listing all scheduled games.</li>
    <li>Pick the team you think will win each matchup.</li>
    <li>One Monday Night game will include a <strong>tie-breaker</strong>: predict the combined final score for both teams.</li>
    <li>Your picks must be submitted before the posted deadline, typically prior to the first game kickoff each week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-4">🧠 Making Picks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Submissions are made via Google Form each week (link provided by the commissioner).</li>
    <li>Picks can be changed until the form closes.</li>
    <li>If no form is submitted, you receive <strong>zero points</strong> for the week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-4">📅 Deadlines & Timing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deadlines are typically <strong>Thursday before the first game</strong>, or <strong>Sunday morning</strong> when no Thursday game is played.</li>
    <li>Forms are reset weekly and <strong>re-open on Tuesday at noon PST</strong> for the next week’s picks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-4">🧮 Scoring System</h4>
  <p>There are two components to your season score:</p>
  <div class="table-responsive">
    <table class="table table-bordered text-center align-middle">
      <thead class="table-light">
        <tr>
          <th>🧱 Metric</th>
          <th>💯 Points</th>
          <th>📈 Max Value</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Correct Picks</td>
          <td>1 point per correct game pick</td>
          <td>272 total games</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Weekly Wins (Most Correct)</td>
          <td>10 points per weekly win</td>
          <td>18 total weeks</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Season Score</strong></td>
          <td><code>= Picks + (Weekly Wins × 10)</code></td>
          <td><strong>Max Score: 452 points</strong></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <h4 class="mt-4">🎯 Tiebreakers</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Closest to tie-breaker (total score guess) for that week.</li>
    <li>Most weekly wins.</li>
    <li>Highest single-week score.</li>
    <li>Coin flip (commissioner discretion if needed).</li>
  </ol>

  <h4 class="mt-4">🏆 Payouts</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Top 5 players</strong> at the end of the season will receive payouts.</li>
    <li>Payout percentages will be shared once all entries are confirmed.</li>
    <li>In the event of a tie for 5th, tiebreakers above will determine the payout position.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-4">❗ Important Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you use the <strong>same player name</strong> each week.</li>
    <li>Missed weeks cannot be made up.</li>
    <li>All decisions by the commissioner are <strong>final</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
